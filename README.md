# Loan Classification Machine Learning Project
## Scenario
In this notebook we try to practice all classification algorithms on Loan whether a loan is paid off on in collection.

We load a dataset using Pandas library, and apply the following algorithms, and find the best one for this specific dataset by accuracy evaluation methods.
This dataset is about past loans. The Loan_train.csv data set includes details of 346 customers whose loan are already paid off or defaulted.

## Machine Learning Models
In thiss project we use 4 Machine Learning Classification Model:
- KNN (K Nearest Neighbor)
- Decision Tree
- SVM (Support Vector Machine)
- Logistic Regression
